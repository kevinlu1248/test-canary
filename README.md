# test-canary Repository
This repository contains scripts for machine learning model training and a simple calculator.

## train.py
The train.py script is a machine learning model training script. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with two convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. The training process uses Stochastic Gradient Descent with a learning rate specified in the configuration file.

To run the script, use the following command:
```
python train.py
```
You can customize the training process by modifying the configuration file (config.yaml).

## calculator.py
The calculator.py script is a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

To run the script, use the following command:
```
python calculator.py
```
Follow the prompts in the interactive calculator to perform calculations.

## config.yaml
The config.yaml file is a configuration file that can be used to customize the training process. You can specify the model architecture, the batch size, the learning rate, and the number of epochs.

Please refer to the comments in the file for more information on how to use it.
