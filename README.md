# test
This project is a machine learning application with a web frontend. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained using PyTorch and the training process is configured using a YAML file. The web frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the model.

## Setup
1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure the project by modifying the `config.yaml` file.
3. Run the project: `python train.py`

## Machine Learning Component
The machine learning component of this project is implemented in the `train.py` file. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained using PyTorch with the training parameters specified in the `config.yaml` file.

## Web Frontend
The web frontend of this project is implemented in the `frontend.html` and `frontend.css` files. It provides a user interface for interacting with the machine learning model. Users can select an image and the model will classify it.

## File Structure
- `train.py`: Implements the machine learning model and the training process.
- `frontend.html`: Contains the HTML code for the web frontend.
- `frontend.css`: Contains the CSS code for styling the web frontend.
- `config.yaml`: Configures the training parameters for the machine learning model.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this project. You can contribute by submitting issues, creating pull requests, or improving the documentation. Please read the code of conduct before contributing.
