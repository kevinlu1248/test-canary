# test-canary: Miscellaneous files for ML + web development
This repository contains code for training a machine learning model, a calculator program, and some frontend CSS.

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model in this repository is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is implemented using PyTorch. The model architecture consists of two convolutional layers, each with a kernel size of 3, a stride of 1, and padding of 1. The first convolutional layer has 16 output channels, and the second convolutional layer has 32 output channels. Each convolutional layer is followed by a ReLU activation function, which introduces non-linearity into the model, and a max pooling layer, which reduces the spatial dimensions of the output. The fully connected layer at the end has a size of 32 * 8 * 8 and is used to classify the input into one of the 10 classes. The training process uses a config file for setting parameters. The parameters include batch size, which determines the number of samples to work through before updating the internal model parameters; learning rate, which controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated; and number of epochs, which is the number of complete passes through the training dataset. To use the config.yaml file, open it in a text editor, update the parameters as needed, and save the file.

## Calculator Program
The calculator program is an interactive program that supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When you run the program, it prompts you to select an operation from the list of supported operations. After you select an operation, it prompts you to input the numbers. For addition, subtraction, and multiplication, you can input any real numbers. For division, you can input any real numbers except for the second number cannot be zero because the division operation does not support division by zero. If you input a non-number or a number that is not valid for the selected operation, the program will display an error message and prompt you to input the numbers again. After you input the numbers, the program performs the selected operation on the input numbers and displays the result.

## Frontend CSS
The frontend CSS in this repository follows the principles of responsive design and accessibility. Responsive design ensures that the layout and elements of the webpage adjust to the screen size and orientation of the device, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices. Accessibility ensures that the webpage is usable by people with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies like screen readers. The CSS code applies these principles by using relative units for sizing, providing sufficient contrast for text, and including alternative text for images. It styles various elements. For headings, it sets the font size, font weight, and color. For images, it sets the width, height, and border. For forms, it sets the margin, padding, and border. For input fields, it sets the width, padding, and border. For submit buttons, it sets the background color, border, and color. It does not have any external dependencies.

## Running the Code
Before you can run the code in this repository, you need to have Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine. You also need to install the required libraries, which include PyTorch for the machine learning model, and Flask for the web application. To install the required libraries, you can use pip, the package installer for Python. Open your terminal and type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries. Once you have Python and the required libraries installed, you can run the code by navigating to the repository directory in your terminal and running the command `python train.py` for the machine learning model, or `python app.py` for the web application. If you need to set any environment variables or command line arguments, you can do so by adding them before the command, like this: `ENV_VAR=value python train.py --arg value`.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository. If you find a bug or have a feature request, please submit an issue. When you submit an issue, please provide a clear description of the issue or feature request, including the expected behavior, the actual behavior, and if possible, steps to reproduce the issue. If you would like to contribute code, please create a pull request. When you create a pull request, please provide a clear description of the changes you made, including the purpose of the changes, the approach you took, and if possible, steps to test the changes. All pull requests will be reviewed by the repository maintainers. The review process may include a code review, where the maintainers will check the quality and correctness of the code; a functionality test, where the maintainers will test the changes to ensure they work as expected; and a discussion with the contributor, where the maintainers and the contributor can discuss any questions or concerns about the changes. Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch.
