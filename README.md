# test
This project is a machine learning application with a web frontend. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained using PyTorch and the training process is configured using a YAML file. The web frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the model. The main purpose of this project is to provide a practical application of machine learning in image classification. The main features of this project include a CNN model for image classification, a web frontend for user interaction, and a YAML file for configuring the training process. This project is intended for users who are interested in machine learning and image classification.

## Setup
1. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Configure the project by modifying the `config.yaml` file.
3. Run the project: `python train.py`

## Machine Learning Component
The machine learning component of this project is implemented in the `train.py` file. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CNN model is a type of deep learning model that is particularly effective for image classification tasks. It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using PyTorch, a popular machine learning library. The training process involves feeding the model with images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual labels. The training parameters, such as the learning rate and the number of epochs, are specified in the `config.yaml` file. The trained model is then used in the web frontend to classify user-selected images.

## Web Frontend
The web frontend of this project is implemented in the `frontend.html` and `frontend.css` files. It provides a user interface for interacting with the machine learning model. The user interface consists of an image selection tool and a display area for the classification result. Users can select an image using the image selection tool. The selected image is then sent to the machine learning model for classification. The classification result is displayed in the display area. The web frontend communicates with the machine learning model through a REST API, which is implemented in the `train.py` file.

## File Structure
- `train.py`: Implements the machine learning model and the training process. It contains the code for defining the CNN model, training the model, and providing a REST API for the web frontend to interact with the model.
- `frontend.html`: Contains the HTML code for the web frontend. It defines the structure of the user interface, including the image selection tool and the display area for the classification result.
- `frontend.css`: Contains the CSS code for styling the web frontend. It defines the appearance of the user interface, including the layout, colors, and fonts.
- `config.yaml`: Configures the training parameters for the machine learning model. It specifies the learning rate, the number of epochs, and other parameters for the training process.
