# test
This project is a machine learning model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It is intended for developers and researchers interested in machine learning and image classification.

## Setup
To set up the project, you will need to have Python 3.7 or later installed. You will also need the torch library, which can be installed using pip:

```
pip install torch
```

## Usage
To use the project, run the train.py script. This will train the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and print the training loss every 200 mini-batches. After training, the script will evaluate the model on the test set and print the accuracy.

## Dependencies
The project has the following dependencies:
- Software: Python 3.7 or later, torch library
- Data: CIFAR-10 dataset
