## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model architecture, training loop, and evaluation on the test set are defined in the 'train.py' file. The configuration for the model and the training process are specified in the 'config.yaml' file.

## Web Frontend
The web frontend is a simple web page that displays the results of the machine learning model. The HTML and CSS files for the frontend are 'frontend.html' and 'frontend.css' respectively.

## Calculator Script
The 'calculator.py' script is a simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes an interactive calculator function that allows users to perform calculations interactively.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. To contribute, you can submit issues, create pull requests, or suggest improvements to the code. Please follow the coding standards specified in the 'CONTRIBUTING.md' file.
