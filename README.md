# test-canary: Miscellaneous files for ML + web development
This repository contains code for training a machine learning model, a calculator program, and some frontend CSS.

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model in this repository is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is implemented using PyTorch. The training process uses a config file for setting parameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.

## Calculator Program
The calculator program is an interactive program that supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It prompts the user to select an operation and input the numbers. Please note that the division operation does not support division by zero.

## Frontend CSS
