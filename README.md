# test-canary
This project is a collection of miscellaneous files for machine learning and web development. It includes machine learning scripts, a web application, and a configuration file.

## Machine Learning Scripts
The machine learning scripts are used for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. To run the scripts, use the command `python train.py`. The output will be the trained model and the accuracy on the test set. The scripts require PyTorch and torchvision to be installed.

## Web Application
The web application is a simple balloon shop where users can select the quantity and color of balloons to order. To set up the web application, open the `frontend.html` file in a web browser. The web application requires a web server to be running.

## Configuration File
The configuration file `config.yaml` contains parameters for the machine learning scripts and the web application. Each parameter is explained in the comments in the file. To modify the parameters, open the file in a text editor and change the values.

## Contributing
